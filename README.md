# Markovchaintextgenerator
Using Markov chain to reproduce works of a great writer

Markov chain has a lot of uses and I created a program that recreates the work of any great writers with the typical words that they use in any of their works. This code takes in the input of any book/poet/poem/etc and recreates the works by learning the typical words that the author uses oftenly after any given word that is picked randomly by the program. The code ought to be run in terminal and the first argument taken is the input file of the document and the second argument taken will be the number of words to be produced by the program
